title: Automated Grayscale Modulation System for High-Precision DLP 3D Printing
description:  Developed an automated grayscale calibration system that corrects non-uniform light distribution in DLP 3D printing. By integrating sensors, motion control, and pixel-level image correction, the solution improved dimensional accuracy and process consistency, enabling more reliable production of high-precision polymer parts.
