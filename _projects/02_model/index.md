title: Irradiation Model and Optimization for DLP Printing 
description: Developed a physics-based irradiation model to simulate voxel-level energy distribution in DLP 3D printing, enabling prediction of cured geometry and croslinking density. Implemented an optimization framework to minimize overcuring for dimensional accuracy, maximize energy for mechanical strength, improving both precision and realiability in printed parts.
