## Developed the physics based irradiation model to predict the curing and crosslinking behavior with inputs like, 2D grayscale images, material properties for 3D printing <br>

## Model prediction very close to the printed features

## T-shape re-entrant textures design, 3D printed and model prediction

## WORK IN PROGRESS.....Stay tuned for published proof
