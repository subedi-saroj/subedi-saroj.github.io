title: Irradiation Model and Optimization for DLP Printing
description:  Developed a physics-based irradiation model to simulate voxel-level energy distribution in DLP 3D printing, enabling prediction of cured geometry and
crosslinking density. Implemented a optimization framework to minimize overcuring for dimensional accuracy, maximizing energy for mechanical strength,
improving both precision and reliability in printed parts.
