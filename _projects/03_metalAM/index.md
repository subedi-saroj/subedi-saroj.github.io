title: Investigation of Powder Characteristics and Microstructural Evolution of Laser Printed Ti-15Mo Samples Prepared by Ball Milling
description:  Investigated the processing of Ti-15Mo alloy using ball milling and Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). Characterized powder properties (SEM, LECO, optical microscopy), optimized printing parameters, and analyzed printed parts for porosity, microstructure, and hardness. Achieved improved understanding of powder spreadability, oxygen contamination control, and parameter effects on density and hardness of Ti-15Mo components.

## This project explored Ti-15Mo as a potential alloy for biomedical and industrial applications due to its strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. The objective was to prepare fine, printable powders via ball milling and investigate their processability in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF).

## Methods
- Ball milled Ti-15Mo powders under different argon-protected conditions and surfactant variations.
- Characterized powders using SEM/EDS, optical microscopy, LECO O₂/H₂ analysis, and Microtrac particle size distribution.
- Performed LPBF cube builds with varying power, scan speed, and hatch spacing.
- Analyzed microstructure, porosity, and hardness of printed samples.

## Key Results
- Extended ball milling (40 hrs, 20:1 ball-to-powder ratio) produced spheroidal powders with improved spreadability.
- Optimal LPBF parameters (95 W, 80 µm hatch spacing, 800 mm/s, 25 µm layer thickness) yielded ~99% dense cubes with reduced porosity.
- Ti-15Mo printed parts demonstrated hardness up to **394 ± 66 HV**, outperforming Cp-Ti and Ti-64 samples.
