description: >- # dont remove this line. this will ignore all new lines until the next section
  I am a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at North Carolina State University, specializing in additive manufacturing (specifically vat-photopolymerization-based 
  3D printing. My research focuses on developing state-of-the-art static and scrolling DLP systems, optimizing energy input for dimensional accuracy, mechanical strength and 
  fabricating functional polymeric materials with potentials for bio-medical, healthcare, soft robotics, electronic devices and many other applications. With experience spanning system design,
  process optimization, and multiphysics simulation, I bridge academic innovation with practical engineering solutions for industry applications.
